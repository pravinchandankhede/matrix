# Security

Security is a core principle of the Matrix Agentic Platform, ensuring protection of data, services, and user access at every layer.

## Authentication
- **Azure AD Integration**: Supports enterprise-grade authentication using Azure Active Directory.
- **JWT Token Validation**: Secure API access with industry-standard token validation.
- **Certificate-Based Auth**: Option for mutual TLS and certificate-based authentication.
- **API Key Management**: For service-to-service and external integrations.

## Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained access policies for users and services.
- **Resource-Based Authorization**: Control access at the resource level.
- **Scope Validation**: Enforce least-privilege access.
- **Claims Transformation**: Custom claims for advanced scenarios.

## Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage using Azure Key Vault.
- **Audit Logging**: Track access and changes for compliance.

## Best Practices
- Regularly review and update access policies.
- Use managed identity and secret management solutions.
- Monitor security events and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
- Perform regular security testing and vulnerability assessments.
