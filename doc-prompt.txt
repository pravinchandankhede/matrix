Refer to the docs folder. I want you to create a overall structure for documentation site hosted on github pages. This is for matrix  agentic platform.  have a section for Platform overview (which may have nested sub pages), Architecture overview whcih will be further subdivided into multiple sections, then Portal overview, then API reference section. I should be able to publish this using github pages.
